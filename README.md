# Advanced Open File

Advanced Open File is fork of
[Advanced New File](https://github.com/Trudko/advanced-new-file), itself
a fork of [Fancy New File](https://github.com/rev087/fancy-new-file).
Thanks to both rev087 and Trudko for their work.

Advanced Open File is a package for helping Atom users to open files and
folders easily. It can also create new files and folders if they don't
exist.

It's basically Advanced New File, but it always shows files and can open
files as well as create them.

All settings can be turned on and off via the built-in settings tab
(`cmd-,`) and selecting Advanced Open File from the list of installed
packages.
